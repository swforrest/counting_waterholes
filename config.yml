output_dir: ./results #AF: created the folder in accordance
tif_dir: ./images/RawImages #AF: created the subfolder in accordance and adapted the path

use_comet: False # If true, make sure comet is setup (needs env vars or a .comet.config file)

# Technical Configuration
# Size of tiles to split images into for processing
TILE_SIZE: 416
# I do beleive YOLO will resize images to work, but this should be the same as the YOLO model was trained on
STRIDE: 104 # Stride for overlapping tiles

CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD: 0.5 # Discard any detections below this

# Distance cutoffs for determining if a boat is the same in two frames AF: Waterholes now
STAT_DISTANCE_CUTOFF_PIX: 3 #AF: to be reviewed later
MOVING_DISTANCE_CUTOFF_PIX: 6 #AF: to be reviewed later
# The lat/long cutoff should be roughly related to the resolution of the images
# For 3m resolution, 10 pix is roughly 30m. At approx -27 deg lat, this is approx 0.0003 degrees.
STAT_DISTANCE_CUTOFF_LATLONG: 0.00025 #AF: to be reviewed later, what's our resolution? 
MOVING_DISTANCE_CUTOFF_LATLONG: 0.0003 #AF: to be reviewed later, what's our resolution?

# Automation Configuration
AUTO_MODE: "batch" # 'batch' or 'single' - whether to run in batch mode or all history at once
# HISTORY_LENGTH: 3 # Days in the past to fetch (new) imagery for
# OR (HISTORY_LENGTH takes precedence):
START_DATE: "2025-01-10" # Date to start fetching imagery from YYYY-MM-DD 
#AF: for now modified for 7 days this month of Jan. 
END_DATE: "2024-01-17" # Date to stop fetching imagery from YYYY-MM-DD
BATCH_SIZE: 7 # Number of days to process (order -> download -> infer) before moving on to next batch

#AF: initialy set the covers to 0.5 both, I modified to 0.1, and 0.9 respectively. 
ALLOWED_CLOUD_COVER: 0.1 # Fraction of image which can be covered by clouds and still be added to day's composite
MINIMUM_AREA_COVERAGE: 0.9 # Fraction of interest area which must be present to download
#AF: base setting was "peel", I put all to test for now. 
AOIS: "all" # Specific AOIs to fetch imagery for (comma separated names of polygons) or "all" for all AOIs in data/polygons

HEATMAP_SIZE: 1000 # Size of each heatmap square (in meters)
